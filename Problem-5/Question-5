Given a positive integer `n`, do the following:

* If `1 <= n <= 9`, print the lowercase English word corresponding to the number.
  (e.g., `1 → one`, `2 → two`, `...`, `9 → nine`)
* Otherwise, print:

```
Greater than 9
```

### Input Format

* A single integer `n`.

---

### Constraints

* `1 <= n` (positive integer)

---

### Output Format

* If `1 <= n <= 9`, print the English word for `n`.
* Otherwise, print `Greater than 9`.
