# HackerRank Challenge: Input and Output

## Objective

Read numbers from `stdin` and print their sum to `stdout`.

---

## Input Format

One line that contains **three space-separated integers**:

```
a b c
```

---

## Constraints

* `0 <= a, b, c <= 100` (typical constraint; HackerRank guarantees input will be in this range)

---

## Output Format

Print the **sum of the three integers** on a single line.

---

## Sample Input

```
1 2 7
```

## Sample Output

```
10
```

---

## Explanation

The sum of the three numbers is `1 + 2 + 7 = 10`.
